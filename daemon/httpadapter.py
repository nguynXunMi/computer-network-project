daemon.httpadapter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This module provides a http adapter object to manage and persist
http settings (headers, bodies). The adapter supports both
raw URL paths and RESTful route definitions, and integrates with
Request and Response objects to handle client-server communication.

    A mutable :class:`HTTP adapter <HTTP adapter>` for managing client connections
    and routing requests.

    The `HttpAdapter` class encapsulates the logic for receiving HTTP requests,
    dispatching them to appropriate route handlers, and constructing responses.
    It supports RESTful routing via hooks and integrates with :class:`Request <Request>`
    and :class:`Response <Response>` objects for full request lifecycle management.
